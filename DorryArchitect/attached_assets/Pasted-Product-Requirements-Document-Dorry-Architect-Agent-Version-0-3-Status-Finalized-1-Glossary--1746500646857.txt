2. Agent Overview
Dorry Architect is an AI-powered agent designed specifically for architects operating in Egypt. Its purpose is to streamline the architectural design process by automating tasks such as environmental analysis, initial design generation considering local context, detailed drawing production, Bill of Quantities (BOQ) generation with local pricing, BIM integration, and compliance verification against Egyptian building codes. The agent aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and cultural relevance in architectural projects, providing robust project management, collaboration features, and natural language interaction via text and Egyptian Arabic voice.

3. Roles
Architect (Primary User): Interacts with the agent to input project requirements, manage projects, generate designs, obtain drawings and BOQ, modify designs, collaborate, and ensure compliance. Uses text and potentially voice commands.
Client: Can view designs (potentially through AR/VR) and provide feedback.
Team Member: Collaborates on designs by adding comments and annotations, managed within project access controls.
System Administrator: Manages user accounts, system settings, and data integrity.
System (Dorry Architect Agent): Performs the core functions based on user input and integrated data sources, providing text and voice output.
4. User Management & Project Management
FR-UM-001: Implement secure user registration and login (Authentication).
FR-UM-002: Allow architects to create, name, save, and load distinct projects.
FR-UM-003: Store project-specific data (inputs, designs, BOQs, conversations) associated with the user and project.
FR-UM-004: Implement basic access control to allow architects to share projects with team members (view/comment permissions initially).
